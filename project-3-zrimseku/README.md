# Project 3: Predictive modeling

Data and details on the data set can be found [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/GSP5KZ49).


## Instructions

If you want to reproduce the work you should follow the instructions in the `predictive_modeling.ipynb`.
In this notebook you can find data preparation and testing of models for identification of anonymous users.
You can find additional scripts for training the models in the folder `scripts`. 
Files `test_index.joblib` and `test_index_timesplit.joblib` are added for the same selection of test and train set. 
 
In the notebook `predicting_interaction.ipynb` the training and testing the models to predict the number of sessions with interaction is implemented.
